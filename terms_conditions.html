                      <li>15.2  A waiver by us of any default will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default.</li>
                      <li>15.3  No waiver by us of any of these terms and conditions will be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing in accordance with clause 12 above.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>16. SEVERABILITY</h3>
                    <p>If any of these terms and conditions or any provisions of a Contract are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

                      <li>17.1  These terms and conditions and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to the subject matter of any Contract.</li>

                      <li>17.3  Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract.</li>
                      <li>17.4  Nothing in this clause limits or excludes any liability for fraud.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>18. OUR RIGHT TO VARY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>18.1  We have the right to revise and amend these terms and conditions from time to time. </li>
